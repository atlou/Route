# Route

Route is a Swift Playground app designed for the **Swift Student Challenge 2024**. The app allows users to visually grasp how A*, Dijkstra's, and Greedy Best-First Search algorithms operate.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Create different maps by placing obstacles and moving the start and target blocks to different locations.
- **Maze Generation:** Challenge the pathfinding algorithms with auto generated mazes.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from three distinct pathfinding algorithms. Each selection comes with a concise description, outlining the algorithm's approach, strengths, and weaknesses.
- **Solving Animation:** Watch a real-time animated visualization of the algorithm as it attempts to find a path.
