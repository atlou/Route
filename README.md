Route is a Swift Playground app designed for the **Swift Student Challenge 2024**. The app allows users to visually grasp how those three **pathfinding algorithms** operate:
- A*
- Dijkstra's
- Greedy Best-First Search

## Features

- **Interactive grid:** Create different maps by placing obstacles and moving the start and target blocks to different locations.
- **Maze generation:** Challenge the pathfinding algorithms with auto generated mazes.
- **Algorithm selection:** Choose from three distinct pathfinding algorithms. Each selection comes with a concise description, outlining the algorithm's approach, strengths, and weaknesses.
- **Real-time solving animation:** Watch an animated visualization of the algorithm as it attempts to find a path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.
- Run the app using an **iPad** simulator in **landscape** mode.

### Installation
1. Clone the project.
2. Open `Route.swiftpm` in Xcode.
3. Choose a simulator (either iPad Pro 11-inch or iPad Pro 13-inch).
4. Press `Run` to build and run the app.
