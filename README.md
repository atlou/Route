# Route

Route is a Swift Playground app designed for the **Swift Student Challenge 2024**. The app allows users to visually grasp how those three **pathfinding algorithms** operate:
- A*
- Dijkstra's
- Greedy Best-First Search

## Features

- **Interactive grid:** Create different maps by placing obstacles and moving the start and target blocks to different locations.
- **Maze generation:** Challenge the pathfinding algorithms with auto generated mazes.
- **Algorithm selection:** Choose from three distinct pathfinding algorithms. Each selection comes with a concise description, outlining the algorithm's approach, strengths, and weaknesses.
- **Real-time solving animation:** Watch an animated visualization of the algorithm as it attempts to find a path.
